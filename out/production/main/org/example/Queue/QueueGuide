Java Queue Interface: A Comprehensive Guide

#1. Queue Interface Overview
-The Queue interface in Java represents a collection designed for holding elements prior to processing that:
-Follows FIFO (First-In-First-Out) by default (except PriorityQueue)
-Supports operations at both ends (head for removal, tail for insertion)
-Provides special methods for failure handling (offer() vs add())

Key - Characteristics
Feature - Description
Ordering - Typically FIFO (except priority queues)
Operations - add(), offer(), remove(), poll(), element(), peek()
Nulls - Most implementations prohibit null
Thread Safety - Generally not thread-safe (except PriorityBlockingQueue)


#2. Queue Implementations Comparison

-LinkedList
Underlying Structure: Doubly-linked list
Best For: General-purpose FIFO operations

Performance:
add()/offer(): O(1)
remove()/poll(): O(1)
peek(): O(1)

Order: FIFO (when used as Queue)
Nulls: Allows null
Extra: Also implements List and Deque

-PriorityQueue
Underlying Structure: Priority heap (min-heap by default)
Best For: Priority-based processing

Performance:
add()/offer(): O(log n)
remove()/poll(): O(log n)
peek(): O(1)

Order: Natural ordering or custom Comparator
Nulls: Does not allow null
Thread Safety: Not thread-safe

-ArrayDeque
Underlying Structure: Resizable circular array
Best For: High-performance stack/queue operations

Performance:
All operations: O(1) amortized
Order: FIFO (when used as Queue) or LIFO (as Stack)
Nulls: Does not allow null
Memory: More compact than LinkedList



#3. Performance Summary
Operation	LinkedList	PriorityQueue	ArrayDeque
add()/offer()	O(1)	O(log n)	O(1)
remove()/poll()	O(1)	O(log n)	O(1)
peek()	O(1)	O(1)	O(1)
Memory Overhead	Higher (node-based)	Medium (heap)	Lower (array)


#4. Method Comparison
Purpose	Throws Exception	Returns Special Value
Insert	add(e)	offer(e)
Remove	remove()	poll()
Examine	element()	peek()


#5. When to Use Each?
LinkedList: When you need flexibility (Queue + List operations)
PriorityQueue: For priority-based processing (e.g., task scheduling)
ArrayDeque: Default choice for pure queue/stack needs (best performance)


#6. Key Takeaways
-ArrayDeque is generally the best performing queue implementation
-PriorityQueue enables custom ordering at logarithmic cost
-LinkedList offers versatility but with higher memory overhead
-All core operations are O(1) except in PriorityQueue (O(log n))
-Prefer offer(), poll(), peek() over exception-throwing alternatives

Best Practices:
-Use ArrayDeque for standard FIFO/LIFO needs
-Choose PriorityQueue when elements need ordered processing
-Consider ConcurrentLinkedQueue for thread-safe requirements
