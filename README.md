## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of implementations and explanations for common Algorithms, Data Structures, and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java. Each topic includes example code and detailed guides explaining the key characteristics and applications.

## Objective

The main goal of this project is to provide detailed access to information about algorithms, data structures, and OOP concepts in a practical way. It serves as:

1. A learning resource for students and professionals
2. A quick reference guide for Java developers
3. A practical example library showing implementation details
4. A comprehensive guide explaining theoretical concepts with practical applications

## Content

### Algorithms
This section includes various algorithm implementations with explanations:
- **Search Algorithms**: Binary Search, Linear Search, BFS - Breadth First Search, Binary Tree Search, DFS - Depth First Search and Knuth Morris Pratt
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Selection Sort and Heap Sort
- **Other Algorithms**: Djikstras and Floyd WarShall

### Data Structures
This section covers implementations of common data structures:
- **Lists**: ArrayList, LinkedList, etc.
- **Queues**: Priority Queue, Regular Queue, etc.
- **Deques**: Double-ended Queue implementations
- **Maps**: HashMap, TreeMap, etc.
- **Sets**: HashSet, TreeSet, etc.

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
This section includes examples of OOP concepts:
- **Abstraction**: Examples and guides about how to hide implementation details
- **Encapsulation**: Examples of bundling data with methods that operate on that data
- **Inheritance**: Examples of creating new classes based on existing ones
- **Polymorphism**: Examples showing different forms of a single entity

## Guides

Each topic includes a detailed guide that covers:
- Theoretical background
- Time and space complexity (for algorithms and data structures)
- Real-world use cases
- Best practices
- Comparative analysis with similar approaches

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/luchersou/Java-DSA-OOP.git
```

2. Navigate to the specific topic you're interested in and explore the examples and guides
3. Run the examples to see the implementations in action
